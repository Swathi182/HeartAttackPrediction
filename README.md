Heart Attack Prediction using Machine Learning algorithms


## Heart Attack Prediction



## Overview

This is my pilot project on checking whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with any cardiovascular heart diseases based on their medical attributes such as gender, age, chest pain, fasting sugar level using Machine Learning algorithms and python packages. I have used the dataset from kaggle website. The dataset contains the data of 304 people medical test results. 166 people having the heart disease and left don't. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no/less chance of heart attack and 1 = more chance of heart attack.
      We will make the machine to learn with the KNN Machine Learning algorithm based on the attributes like chest pain, sugar level etc... Created a dummy variable for few attributes then the dataset splits into two different parts as train and test the data. Then selected the appropriate model and get the confusion matrix from the seaborn library for getting the clear observation. At last checked the accuracy_score.
